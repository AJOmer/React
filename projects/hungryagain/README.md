# Hungry Again
 
 Through leveraging TheMealDB API, this application makes a call to a random recipe generator and fetches recipes for hearty meal inspirations. Users can view the ingredients,   instructions, and a demonstrated step-by-step video link on youtube. This application was developed using React as the frontend JavaScript library, Express & Node.js for backend support, TheMealDB API to fetch recipes, and styled with ReactStrap. This application was deployed with Heroku.
